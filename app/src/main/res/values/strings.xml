        <h3>Tips for Living With Depression </h3><br />
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h5>Build a Support Network </h5>
                <p>One of the most important things you can do to help yourself with depression—other
                    than medication and therapy—is to develop strong social support.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>Reduce Your Stress </h5>
                <p>If you or a loved one are struggling with depression,
                    contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)
                    National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for information on support and
                    treatment facilities in your area. </p>
            </li>
             <li>
                <h5>Improve Your Sleep Hygiene</h5>
                <p><i>Good sleep hygiene could be key to improving the quality and quantity of your sleep.</i>
                 Turn off electronics at least an hour before you go to bed. Use dim light to read a
                    book or engage in another relaxing activity.
                    Only use your bed for sleep and sexual activity. Doing work in bed, or even in your bedroom,
                    can cause you to associate your bed with stress, rather than relaxation.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>Improve Your Eating Habits</h5>
                <p><i>Improving your diet could be key to reducing your symptoms.</i>
                 But before you make any major changes to your diet or begin taking
                    vitamins or supplements, talk with your physician.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>Learn How to Stop Negative Thoughts</h5>
                <p>Depression doesn\'t just make you feel bad, it can also cause you to think more negatively.
                    Changing those negative thoughts, however, can improve your mood.
                </p>
            </li>
             <li>
                <h5>Beat Procrastination </h5>
                <p>Putting things off fuels depression. It can lead to increased guilt, worry, and stress.
                </p>
